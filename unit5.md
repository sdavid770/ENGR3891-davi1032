# Unit 5 : Basic Firewall Task
## Setup

For this Scenario, both virutal machines are connected to the host computer network via a NAT and internal netowrk called Sean's Network.Each virtual machine has been assigned a unique MAC Address.

## Ip Configuration
To get the two machines communicatiing with each other, both of them need to be assigned an IP address. As the two machines have been connected to a NAt network, they have already been assigned via DHCP of 10.1.1.1/24 and 10.1.1.2/24. Both of which are using enp0s8 as their internal network interface

If the Network is based on Static Ip allocation, the commands below will assign the correct ipaddress to each VM.
